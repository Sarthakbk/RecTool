# 🚀 Quick Startup Guide

## ✅ **Frontend is NOW WORKING!**

Your React frontend should be starting up and will be available at:
**http://localhost:3000**

## 🔧 **To Start the Backend (Python Server):**

### Step 1: Install Python
1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

cd jd-management

# Start the Python server
python simple_server.py
```

## 🌐 **Access Your Application:**
